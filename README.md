# Data-Analysis-Machine-Learning-for-Risk-Modelling
## Project Overview
This project is part of the COMP1916 assessment and focuses on data analysis, visualization, and machine-learning techniques to derive insights from complex datasets. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms.

Key objectives of this project include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset for accurate analysis.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using statistical methods and visualizations.
- Implementing machine learning models to make predictions and extract meaningful patterns.
- Evaluating model performance using relevant metrics.
- Presenting findings in a structured, clear, and insightful manner.
